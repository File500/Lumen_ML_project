HOW TO use this folder

monk_skin_color_clustering
    classify images using K-means clustering 
    when run u get new csv with new column skin type

monk_pretrained_model
    if some pretrained model is available you can use ran this script

create_monk_skin_tone_training_data
    uses when you already have labeled datda to get balanced labeled dataset for training new model for this purpose
    best used after running clustering

monk_skin_tone_main
     it will:
        Use a pre-trained model if available
        Train a new model from labeled data if available
        Fall back to clustering if neither is available
    use this if you dont know what to do

Suggested Approach:
    Run clustering on a subset: monk_skin_color_clustering.py
    Create labeled data: create_monk_skin_tone_training_data.py
    Train a model: trainer/monk_skin_tone_training.py
    Classify all images with the model: monk_skin_tone_main.py
